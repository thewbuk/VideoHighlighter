"""
Tests for modules.segments.shot_window — which seconds of a clip are worth using.

The measurement itself needs OpenCV, which conftest replaces with a MagicMock,
so what is pinned here is everything downstream of it: that a window is chosen
by score rather than by position, that the search never hands back a stretch
that was already spoken for, and that a clip nobody could measure behaves
exactly as it did before this module existed. Those are the properties the
planner depends on; the pixel maths is validated against real footage, where
the answer can actually be looked at.
