"""R3D on DirectML: the device it lands on, and what happens when it can't run.

R3D is a 3D CNN, and 3D convolution is the least certain part of DirectML's
operator coverage. Nobody here has an AMD card, so "does conv3d work on
DirectML" is not a question this file can answer and does not try to. What it
pins is the thing that decides how bad the answer is if it turns out to be no:

  * the device string reaching the wrapper at all (it used to be discarded — the
    old `torch.device(d if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')` collapsed every
    non-NVIDIA machine to the processor, silently), and
  * the warm-up demoting the model to the CPU instead of letting an
    "operator is not currently implemented" out into a run.

The second is why enabling this is defensible at all: the worst case is the
behaviour the app already had, plus one line of explanation.

`action_recognition` imports torch and torchvision at module scope, so this
file leans on conftest's shims and never touches a real model.
