"""Tests for what it would take to measure something the run has no signal for.

The advice this produces costs the user real time — an afternoon of labelling
is the expensive branch — so the properties worth pinning down are the ones
that would make it waste some:

* a route is never offered without the prerequisite it needs in this run;
* the proxy route, which measures the *talking* rather than the thing, is never
  presented as a way to measure the thing;
* the cheap five-minute test is offered before the expensive route, not after;
* the ranking is over cost and reliability and nothing else — this module is
  never told what was said, and could not use it if it were.

Fixture classes are named after workshop objects, as elsewhere: the repo ships
no vocabulary of its own and nothing here knows one class name from another.
