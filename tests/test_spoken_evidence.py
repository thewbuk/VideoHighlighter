"""Tests for corroborating what a stretch says against what the run measured.

The feature exists so a narration can *disagree* with a speaker, so most of
what is worth testing is the ways it could quietly stop being able to:

* the evidence is video-wide, not chapter-local — somebody describing in the
  last chapter something that happened in the middle is the ordinary case, and
  a row that only looked here would report it as never having happened;
* a class the detector barely found still produces a row, because "labelled for
  under eight seconds" beside a sentence calling it the best part of the file
  is the finding, not a failure;
* matching is loose enough to fire on speech and tight enough not to fire on
  everything — both failures are silent, and the first one shipped;
* the figures reach the page as well as the prompt, so the paragraph the model
  writes from them can be checked without trusting it;
* a report whose analysis ran hours ago can still gain the section, because
  that is how the narration is actually used.

Fixture classes are named after workshop objects. The matching path does not
care what a class is called, and the repo carries no vocabulary of its own.
