"""Tests for `modules.audio.music_analysis`.

Fixtures are synthesised with numpy and the stdlib `wave` module, so the
default path of this file needs no ffmpeg, no network and no music: a click
track is a signal whose beat times are known exactly, which is the only way to
say whether a beat tracker is right rather than merely plausible.

The trap this file exists to catch is a beat grid that *looks* fine — evenly
spaced, sensible count — while sitting at half or double the real tempo, or
drifting a few milliseconds per bar until the last cut lands off the beat.
Both produce an edit that feels wrong for reasons nobody can name, and neither
shows up unless the test knows where the beats really were.

Only the numpy backend is exercised. librosa is optional, is not installed in
the test environment, and is mocked out by tests/conftest.py — which is itself
a trap worth a test, since a mock imports perfectly and answers every question
with another mock.
