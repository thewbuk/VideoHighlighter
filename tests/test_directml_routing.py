"""Where a DirectML device is allowed to win, and where it must not.

`test_directml_device.py` covers the probe. This covers the independent
`resolve_device` implementations that consume it, because the value of an
experimental backend is decided entirely by its position in each of those
orderings:

  * too eager, and it displaces CUDA or Arc on machines that had a faster path,
    turning a working install into a slow one for no reason;
  * too timid, and the AMD box it exists for still runs everything on the CPU.

The probes are separate on purpose (each module documents why it does not
import `modules.system.device_utils`), which is exactly the arrangement where one of
them silently drifts. So each is pinned here.

`describe_devices()` is not covered: it exists only in the Pro edition, for a
training panel this one does not have.
