Shared pytest fixtures + heavy-dependency import shims.

Why shims?
==========
The production code imports heavy ML libraries (torch, opencv, whisper,
openvino) at module-load time. We deliberately want
the test suite to run **without** those installed so a CI job can validate
pure logic (forbidden-range math, clustering, SRT formatting) in seconds rather
than minutes, and so a contributor can run `pytest` after `pip install -r
requirements-dev.txt` (a 5 MB install) instead of `requirements.txt` (1.9 GB).

The shims here replace those heavy deps with `MagicMock` *only if* they are not
already importable. If a contributor has a full dev env installed, the real
libraries are used.

What is NOT shimmed
===================
`yaml` is deliberately NOT shimmed either. It is a ~250 KB parser rather than a
heavy ML library, so it costs nothing to install, and mocking it is actively
wrong: `MagicMock.safe_load()` returns a MagicMock instead of a dict, so
anything driven by a YAML file (the composition rules engine) silently parses
to nothing and its tests assert against an empty rule set that looks valid. It
is in `requirements-dev.txt` for the same reason a real parser always is.

`numpy` is a real dependency of the tests (the pipeline math operates on numpy
arrays) and is installed alongside pytest. `collections`, `os`, `re`, etc. are
stdlib.
