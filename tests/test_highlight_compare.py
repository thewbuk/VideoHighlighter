"""Tests for `modules.segments.highlight_compare` — subjects ranked against their video.

The property worth protecting is that a size claim survives the camera moving.
Frame share cannot tell a larger subject from a nearer one, so the module's
whole reason to exist is the ratio against a second box in the same frame — and
the test that matters is the one where those two measurements disagree.

Class names here are ordinary nouns chosen to be uninteresting. The module has
no vocabulary of its own and compares a class only against itself, so what the
detector was taught to find never reaches this code.
