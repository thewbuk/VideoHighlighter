"""
Tests for modules.segments.reel_plan — the short-form story arrangement.

What is worth pinning here is not that the function returns cuts, but that the
three claims it makes are true of the result: that the reel lands near the
length that was asked for, that its cutting rate falls in the band the chosen
pace names, and that the structure is actually a structure — the hook first and
alone, the payoff held longer than the body, everything else in the order it
was shot.

Sources are generated once as tiny clips, since the planner only reads their
durations.
