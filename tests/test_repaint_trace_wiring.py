"""The recorder wired into the real scene, on the path that crashes.

Unit-testing the recorder proves it writes lines. What matters is whether those
lines appear at the moment a user moves the confidence slider, and whether they
say anything a person could act on — so this drives the actual
`SignalTimelineScene` rather than a stand-in.

It also pins the finding the wiring produced, and the fix for it. `clear()`
deletes the C++ objects behind `current_time_line` and `current_time_caret`,
and `build_timeline` repositions the playhead before it returns — so until
those references were dropped alongside the selection ones, every confidence
adjustment reached through a deleted wrapper. That is undefined behaviour
rather than a defined no-op, and it survived often enough to present as an
occasional crash with no traceback instead of a reproducible exception, which
is precisely why it needed a recorder to find.
