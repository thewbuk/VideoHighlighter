"""
Tests for modules.segments.shot_place — which clips were shot from the same spot.

The grouping rules are pinned against the numbers that motivated them, taken
from a real shoot: four pairs of clips filmed 11-127 m apart within two minutes
of each other, and one pair 479 m apart that must stay separate because they
are two genuinely different views of the same valley. Those two facts are what
the thresholds sit between, so they are what the tests assert.

Reading a file's own metadata needs ffprobe and is exercised end to end
elsewhere; what is pinned here is everything that decides the edit.
