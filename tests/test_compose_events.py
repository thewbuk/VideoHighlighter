"""Tests for re-running composition rules over detections that may be cached.

The bug this module was written for is invisible by construction: a user edits a
rule, re-runs, and the report is unchanged — because the detections came from
cache and the engine, which lived inside the detection branch, never executed.
Nothing failed and nothing was logged. `test_runs_on_a_cached_pass` is the guard,
and it is the only test here that would have caught the original.

The rest are about idempotence, which is what running on every pass makes
necessary. Cached detections already carry the previous pass's event names, and
the cached boxes already carry the previous pass's event boxes. Three distinct
ways that goes wrong if the strip is missed:

* `test_running_twice_changes_nothing` — events double up in the detections;
* `test_a_deleted_rule_does_not_outlive_its_file` — an event nobody has a rule
  for any more stays in the report for ever;
* `test_event_boxes_are_not_fed_back_in_as_detections` — the worst, because the
  result is still plausible: a rule matching against its own previous output.

Class names here are workshop objects. Neither the engine nor this module holds
a vocabulary, which is why any will do.
