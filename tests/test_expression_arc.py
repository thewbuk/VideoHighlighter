"""Tests for `modules.vision.expression_arc` — the shape of the expression reading.

Two properties are worth protecting, and only one of them is about arithmetic.

The first is that the module finds real structure: a file that reads one way and
then another has a split, and the split is where the change actually is.

The second is that it argues against itself when it should. A five-class
classifier let loose on footage it was not trained for produces a confident,
uniform, completely wrong distribution, and every number downstream inherits
that. The dispersion, coverage and stability checks exist to make that case
visible rather than authoritative — so the tests that matter most here are the
ones where the module is handed convincing-looking rubbish and has to say so.
