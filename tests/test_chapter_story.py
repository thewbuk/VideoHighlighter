"""Tests for the per-chapter narration — the boundary, not the prose.

Nothing here can check whether a paragraph is any good; a model wrote it. What
can be checked is everything around it, and that is where this feature can hurt
someone:

* a chapter is told from *its own* material and not the whole report's, so a
  paragraph cannot describe a stretch it was never shown;
* one failed or empty call costs one paragraph and not the run;
* what a model wrote is stored and rendered as a reading, with the model named,
  and never merged into the measured sentences beside it;
* the chapters are told in order, each handed the one before it, and a skipped
  chapter is not passed off as the predecessor of the next.

Fixture speech is mundane on purpose — a workshop, a kitchen. The narration
path does not care what was said, and the repo carries no content.
