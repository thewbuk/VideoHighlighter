"""The flight recorder for repaints — chiefly, that it never becomes the bug.

It runs on the path that is already crashing, so the bar is not "does it record
well" but "can it be the reason something fell over". Every entry point has to
survive being called before arming, with a dead Qt wrapper, or with values that
do not serialise.
