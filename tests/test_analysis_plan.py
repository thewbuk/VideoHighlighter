"""Tests for second-run behaviour — the bug class that keeps coming back.

Every case here is a *pair* of runs: one that writes a cache, one that reuses
it with different scoring settings. That framing is the point. The pipeline's
first run has been correct throughout; what broke, repeatedly and silently, was
the run after it, and no test that considered a single run in isolation could
have caught any of the three instances found so far.

`TestTheInvariant` is the durable half. The others pin down today's behaviour;
that one fails when someone adds a *new* detector gated by a scoring weight
without deciding what a cached run should do about it — which is exactly how
this bug arrived each time.
