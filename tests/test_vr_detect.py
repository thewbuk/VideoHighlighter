"""Noticing that a frame holds two eyes, without being told.

The cost of the two possible mistakes is not symmetric. Missing side-by-side
footage leaves the filmstrip as it was — every thumbnail centre-cropped onto
the seam between the eyes, which is what prompted this. Claiming it on flat
footage silently hides half of every frame, and the person watching has no
reason to suspect the app of cropping. So the geometry gate is deliberately
narrow and the halves have to actually agree before anything is cropped.

The clips here are synthesised rather than sampled from real footage: the
formats worth pinning are the ones that fool a single test — a panorama, whose
halves are the same room but not the same picture, and a symmetric composition,
whose halves *are* each other, mirrored.
