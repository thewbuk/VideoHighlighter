"""Every run that can show detection frames must be handed a way to show them.

The live preview is opt-in from one checkbox, so the user reads it as a property
of the app: tick it, and runs show their frames. It is actually a property of
each *call site* — `run_highlighter(..., preview_fn=...)` — and a call site that
omits the argument does not fail, warn, or look any different. The window opens,
holds its "Waiting for the detection stage" placeholder for the whole run, and
the only conclusion available to the user is that the preview is broken.

That is what happened: the Run button passed `preview_fn`, and the
download-and-process path (`start_download` → `process_video_callback`) did not,
so a downloaded video processed on the spot never fed the window while the same
video started from Run did.

Source-level rather than behavioural, deliberately. Reaching these call sites
for real means a QApplication, a download worker and a full pipeline over a real
video with the OpenVINO models loaded — none of which CI has (see conftest: the
suite runs without the heavy deps and without Qt). The defect is an omitted
keyword argument at a call site, so a check that reads the call sites catches
exactly it, in milliseconds, on a machine with nothing installed.
