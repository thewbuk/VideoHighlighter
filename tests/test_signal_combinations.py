"""Tests for `modules.segments.signal_combinations` — is this combination actually unusual?

The property worth protecting is that the module is willing to deflate a
finding. Four signals agreeing inside one clip looks like a discovery, and on
footage that produces the same four marks in every stretch it is the norm
wearing a discovery's clothes. A base rate is the only thing that can tell those
apart, so the tests that matter most here are the ones where the combination is
everywhere and the module has to say so.
