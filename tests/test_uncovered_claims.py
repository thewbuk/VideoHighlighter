"""Tests for the lines a report quotes and has no measurement for.

The section exists because of a specific silence: a chapter block where
somebody says something substantial about a thing nothing was watching for
carries the quote and no figures, which on the page is indistinguishable from a
claim that was checked and held. So the tests are mostly about the ways it
could stop noticing that:

* a claim said exactly *once* has to surface, because that is the shape of the
  sentence this exists for — a frequency threshold cannot reach it at any
  setting, which is why :mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap` is not enough;
* a line some class already covers must *not* appear, or the section
  contradicts the measurements printed above it;
* an interjection must not outrank an assertion, which is the one thing
  inherited scoring would get backwards;
* the section has to appear on a record analysed hours earlier, because that is
  when people read these reports.

Fixture classes are named after workshop objects. Nothing in the module knows
what a class is called, and the repo carries no vocabulary of its own.
