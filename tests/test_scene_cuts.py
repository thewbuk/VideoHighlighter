"""Tests for the shot-cut policy — when to trust 70, and when to stop trusting it.

The distributions here are built to match measurement rather than intuition. The
"film" fixture uses the median (14.2) and MAD (4.8) taken from a real 5-minute
stretch whose maximum difference anywhere was 47 — a video on which the fixed
threshold of 70 cannot fire even once. The "broadcast" fixture is the opposite
case, material that clears 70 regularly, and its job in this file is to prove
the fallback leaves it alone.

That asymmetry is the whole design: the fixed threshold works on the footage it
was tuned for, so a fix that changed those results would be a regression wearing
a fix's clothes.
