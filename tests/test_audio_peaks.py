"""Peak detection over int16 audio, where the loudest sample is the hard case.

Reported from a run: "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute"
on every chunk. The warning is the visible half. The invisible half is that a
sample at full negative scale, -32768, has no positive counterpart in int16, so
``abs()`` wrapped it back to -32768, it failed a comparison against a positive
threshold, and the single loudest moment in clipped audio was dropped — by the
function whose whole job is to find loud moments.
