"""
Tests for how a finished run is counted toward the lifetime analyzed total.

Two things make this easy to get wrong:

1. run_highlighter returns different shapes. A single video returns the output
   path (or None on failure); a batch returns [(input_path, output_or_None), ...]
   -- see pipeline.py:373. Counting len() on the batch shape counts the failures
   as successes.
2. Only main.py used to increment the counter, inside its own pipeline_done
   handler, so a run driven from anywhere else (the web UI's sidecar) left the
   lifetime total at 0 no matter how many videos it processed.
