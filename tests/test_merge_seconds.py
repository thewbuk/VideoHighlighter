"""
Characterization tests for `compute_forbidden._merge_seconds`.

This function turns a set of "this whole second is forbidden" integer markers
into merged (start, end) float ranges, bridging gaps up to `merge_gap` seconds.
It drives the AVOID(skip) flow: any second that lands inside one of these
ranges has its highlight score zeroed.

We freeze current behaviour as a regression baseline before any pipeline
refactor.
