"""
Regression guard: the helpers moved to `modules.pipeline_helpers` must remain
importable under their old names from `pipeline` itself.

This file exists to catch the obvious break: a future contributor cleans up
the import shim at the top of `pipeline.py` without realising other files
(`object_recognition.py`, possibly user scripts) still do
`from pipeline import seconds_to_mmss`.

If this test ever needs to be deleted, it is because every caller of the
legacy import has been updated and a deprecation cycle has fully completed.
Do not delete it for any other reason.
