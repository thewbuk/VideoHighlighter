"""
Characterization tests for `auto_segments.Region`.

`Region` is the candidate-segment data class used during auto-segmentation. The
overlap math drives merging: two adjacent or overlapping regions should
collapse into one. The score addition policy is what makes "many signals fired
here" rank above "one signal fired here" during selection.
