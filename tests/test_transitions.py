"""
Tests for modules.media.transitions against real ffmpeg.

Two things can go wrong here and only one of them is visible in a duration
check. The offsets can be wrong, which shows up as a reel of the wrong length;
or the filtergraph can be built correctly and blend nothing, which does not.
So the transition tests sample actual pixels through the join: a crossfade from
red to blue must be purple in the middle, and a dip to black must be black
there. A reel that is exactly the right length and cuts hard would pass every
timing assertion in this file and fail those.

Clips are generated at 160x120 so a whole reel builds in a second or two.
