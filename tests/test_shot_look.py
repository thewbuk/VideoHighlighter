"""
Tests for modules.segments.shot_look — do two clips look like the same view.

The module makes one narrow claim: that the *smaller* of a layout agreement
and a colour agreement is high only when both are, and that either on its own
is not usable. That claim is what these tests pin, because it is the whole
reason the module is shaped the way it is — and because a later change to
"just average the two" would look tidier, pass any test of the plumbing, and
quietly bring back the false pairs the conjunction exists to reject.

Measuring a real clip needs OpenCV, which conftest replaces with a MagicMock,
so the descriptors here are written by hand.
