"""
Tests for `modules.audio.vocal_signals` — per-second vocal brightness and onset.

Driven by synthetic audio rather than a fixture video, so the suite keeps its
"no heavy deps, seconds not minutes" property and so each property is tested
against a signal whose answer is known by construction rather than by having
been listened to.

What is pinned here is the *contract*, not the numbers: that brightness tracks
spectral centre of mass, that onset tracks a rise in level, that both are
normalised against the video's own voice rather than an absolute, and that the
gate rejects broadband noise. The thresholds themselves were fitted on labelled
material and are recorded in the module, where their justification is.
