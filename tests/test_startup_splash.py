"""The startup splash: safe to call from anywhere, and always comes down again.

`stage()` is deliberately callable before Qt exists, before any splash is up,
and after one is torn down — `main.py` calls it from between its imports and
`signal_timeline_viewer` calls it whether or not anyone opened a splash first.
That freedom is only safe if none of those paths can raise, which is what most
of this file pins down.

The other half is the teardown. The splash is always-on-top and frameless, so
one that survives its own failure sits over the app with nothing behind it and
no way to dismiss it.
