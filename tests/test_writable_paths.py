"""Where a packaged app is allowed to write, and where it works from.

Both halves of one bug. A macOS .app launches with the working directory set to
``/`` and lives inside a bundle that must be treated as read-only, so the dozens
of call sites that default to ``./cache`` all failed with "[Errno 30] Read-only
file system: 'cache'" the moment a video was opened.

Everything here runs on any platform: the frozen macOS case is `sys.frozen` and
`sys.platform` monkeypatched, because that is exactly what the code reads.
