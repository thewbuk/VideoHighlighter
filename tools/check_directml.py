"""Report whether DirectML is usable on this machine, and prove it is not lying.

DirectML's failure modes are quiet ones. It reports a device and runs, so
"it works" is easy to believe while the run is slower than the CPU it replaced.
Three separate things can be true at once and look identical from outside:

  1. It picked the wrong adapter. DirectML enumerates *every* DX12 adapter --
     the integrated GPU, and Microsoft's software renderer -- so device 0 is
     not necessarily the graphics card you bought.
  2. It has the card but not its memory. A backend that sees a fraction of the
     real VRAM swaps to disk on every batch, which shows up as a saturated
     system, an idle GPU, and no error anywhere. This is the single most
     commonly reported DirectML problem and it costs an order of magnitude.
  3. It has the card and the memory and is simply slower than the CPU for the
     op mix in question, because DirectML falls back per operator.

So this answers, on whatever machine it runs on:

  * Is torch-directml installed, does it import, and is the torch beside it the
    version it was built against?
  * Which adapters does it see, and which one would the app take?
  * Does a real forward pass produce finite numbers that agree with the CPU?
  * How much memory can it actually allocate, in one block?
  * Is it faster than this machine's CPU, and by how much?

    python -m tools.check_directml
    python -m tools.check_directml --size 2048     # bigger matmul
    python -m tools.check_directml --skip-benchmark

Exits non-zero when DirectML is unusable, disagrees with the CPU reference, or
turns out to be slower than the CPU -- so it works as a smoke test on an AMD
machine, not just as a printout.

Needs torch and torch-directml. Nothing else in the app is imported beyond
`modules.system.directml_device`, which is stdlib-only, so this runs in the isolated
DirectML virtualenv that docs/AMD-GPU.md recommends.
