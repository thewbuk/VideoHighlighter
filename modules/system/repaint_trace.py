"""A flight recorder for the timeline's rebuilds.

The crash this exists for leaves nothing behind. Adjusting a confidence filter
or a merge gap rebuilds the whole scene, and the process dies somewhere inside
Qt's C++ side, where a Python traceback cannot form and `sys.excepthook` never
runs. The only evidence is whatever reached the disk *before* the process
stopped — so this writes eagerly and flushes every line, and never holds a
breadcrumb back to fold into a tidier summary later. A summary is exactly the
thing that never gets written.

Two things it records, because the two candidate failures look identical from
outside and need opposite fixes:

* **What a rebuild was for** — which control moved, what it moved to, and
  whether a rebuild was already running when this one started. Re-entering
  `build_timeline` while a previous `clear()` is still unwinding is a live
  suspect, and it is invisible unless something counts.

* **Whether the Python-side references to scene items are still backed by a
  live C++ object.** `QGraphicsScene.clear()` deletes those objects but leaves
  the Python attributes pointing at the corpses. A reference that outlives a
  rebuild does not fail at the point of the mistake — it fails later, on the
  next playhead tick, which is why the traceback (when there is one at all)
  never names the code that actually went wrong.

Nothing here changes what the app does, and every entry point swallows its own
errors: a recorder that can raise is a second bug stacked on the one being
chased. `probe` in particular must be safe to call on a dangling wrapper, since
that is its entire job — it asks shiboken whether the object is valid rather
than poking the object and hoping.
