"""Replace a clip the user does not want with the best one that lost to it.

Re-choosing a moment needs the per-second score, which used to exist only inside
a pipeline run. The report now persists it (``curves.score_per_second``), so this
module can offer an alternative from a finished cut with no video file, no
detector and no re-analysis — a sort over an array that is already on disk.

State lives in :class:`SwapSession` because swapping is a conversation, not a
call: the moments already turned down have to accumulate, or pressing the button
twice offers the same clip again. The UI holds one session per cut and asks it
for the current segments; rendering stays a separate, explicit step, so trying
alternatives never costs an encode.
