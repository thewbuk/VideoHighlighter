"""How unusual a combination of marks is, measured against the video's own rate.

Every other explanation in the report describes one moment. This one answers the
question that comes after: *is that combination actually unusual here, or does
this video do it all the time?*

It is worth having because the answer is frequently "all the time", and nothing
else in the report can say so. A clip where something arrives on screen,
movement bursts, the sound peaks and the expression reading turns looks like a
finding — four independent signals agreeing. If the video produces that same
combination in most of its stretches, it is not a finding about the clip, it is
a description of the footage, and the four signals agreeing tells you only that
they always agree here.

The measurement is a base rate and nothing more:

    of the video's comparable stretches, how many carry at least these marks?

That is the one form of "how likely is this" the material can support. It is a
frequency over stretches of this file, computed the same way for every clip, and
it says nothing whatever about *what* the combination means — no set of these
marks implies a cause, an intention or an experience, and the rarity of a
combination is not evidence for any particular reading of it. A rare combination
is a good place to look; that is the whole of the claim.

Stretches are non-overlapping and all the same length, because a rate over
windows that share seconds counts the same event several times, and a rate over
windows of different lengths compares a long stretch's chance of containing a
mark with a short one's.
