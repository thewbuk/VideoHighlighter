"""Decide where the shot cuts are, from the frame differences already measured.

``detect_scenes_motion_optimized`` compares each sampled frame with the one
before it and averages the absolute difference over every pixel — one number per
frame pair, on a 0-255 scale. A cut was declared wherever that number exceeded a
fixed threshold of 70.

That threshold is unreachable on a great deal of ordinary footage, and the
reason is worth stating because it is not obvious. The measurement is a mean
over ~100,000 pixels, and averaging is brutal: a hard cut between two completely
different shots produces a *small* mean whenever the two happen to share overall
brightness. The number only grows large when total luminance swings — a dark
room to bright daylight. Saturated, high-contrast material clears 70 regularly;
a conventionally graded film never does. Measured on one 60-minute film, the
maximum difference anywhere in it was 31.7, so no cut could ever be declared and
the whole film came back as a single scene.

This is the same flaw ``modules/audio/reaction_bursts.py`` documents in
``modules/audio/audio_peaks.py``'s fixed -20 dBFS: an absolute threshold describes the
*mastering*, not the content, so one number cannot serve two videos.

The fix here is deliberately conservative, because the fixed threshold works
well on the material it was tuned for and changing that would be a regression
dressed as a fix. So the configured threshold is tried first, and only when it
has *evidently* failed — implausibly few cuts across the whole video — are the
cuts recomputed from the same differences against a threshold derived from that
video's own distribution. Footage where 70 works is untouched.

Nothing here decodes anything. The differences are computed by the detector's
existing pass, so recalibration costs one more sweep over an array of floats and
no second read of the video. That also makes the policy testable on synthetic
distributions in milliseconds — see ``tests/test_scene_cuts.py``.
