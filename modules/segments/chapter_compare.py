"""Say how each chapter differs from the rest of its own video.

:mod:`modules.segments.highlight_compare` answers that question for a *clip*, and does it
by ranking the clip's peak against sliding windows of the clip's own length.
That method does not transfer to a chapter, and it is worth being precise about
why, because the obvious move is to reuse it.

A clip is ten or twenty seconds and is described by its strongest moment, so
"how does this maximum rank among other windows this long" is both answerable
and meaningful. A chapter is minutes. Windows of that length barely fit in the
video -- a ten-minute chapter of a ninety-minute film has eight non-overlapping
peers -- so a percentile computed against them is an artefact of the sample. And
a maximum is the wrong statistic anyway: a chapter is not characterised by its
loudest second, it is characterised by what is true *throughout* it.

So this module compares **shares and rates** instead:

* **Share of the cut.** What fraction of the kept clips came from this chapter,
  against what fraction of the runtime it occupies. A chapter holding 10% of the
  film and 40% of the highlights is the single most useful fact a chapter
  breakdown can carry, and it needs no detector at all.
* **Prevalence lift.** For each detected class, the share of this chapter's
  detected seconds carrying it, divided by that share across the whole video.
  This is a proportion over hundreds of seconds rather than a rank among eight
  peers, so it has the sample size the percentile lacked.
* **Expression mix.** The same ratio applied to the per-second expression read.
* **Pace and level.** Cutting rate and median loudness against the video's own,
  which are properties of how a stretch was shot and mixed rather than of what
  is in it.

Every ratio ships with the counts behind it. A lift of 4.0 computed from three
seconds is noise wearing a number's clothes, and the only defence is that the
reader can see the three. :data:`MIN_SECONDS_FOR_LIFT` marks where a ratio
becomes reportable; nothing is suppressed, but the flag means the prose layer
does not have to re-derive that judgement -- the same split
:mod:`modules.segments.highlight_compare` keeps.

**This module computes, it does not characterise.** No adjectives, no "unusual",
no ordering beyond a stable sort by effect size. What is worth saying out loud
belongs to :mod:`modules.report.highlight_prose`, so a threshold lives in one place.

Content is not this module's business: it compares a class against itself and
holds no vocabulary of its own. Whatever the detector was taught to find, the
same arithmetic applies.
