"""What was said in each chapter, and what that says about the chapter.

``modules/segments/chapters.py`` divides a video on how it *looks* and refuses to name
the result, for a stated reason: a vector is a point, not a name, and this repo
ships no vocabulary to match points against. Its docstring names the way out --
a caller that has a vocabulary can label the partition afterwards -- and a
transcript is exactly that, with the useful property that it came out of the
user's own footage rather than out of a list somebody shipped.

So this module is the labelling half. It takes the partition and the Whisper
segments and, per chapter, measures:

* how much of the stretch is speech at all, against the video's own rate;
* which words this stretch used that the other stretches did not;
* the lines carrying those words, timestamped so they can be played;
* who was speaking, when diarization ran.

Distinctiveness is inverse document frequency over the chapters, and the choice
matters more than it looks. A stop-word list would have to be per-language and
would be wrong the moment someone transcribes a language nobody thought about;
IDF needs no list, because a word used in every chapter carries no information
about any of them and falls out with a weight of zero. The video supplies its
own stop words. That also keeps this module honest about the repo's rule that
no vocabulary ships here: nothing below contains a word of anybody's content.

What this is not
----------------

It does not interpret. "These words are unusual for this stretch of this video"
is a measurement; "this is the scene where X happens" is a reading, and the
reading belongs to the person -- or, clearly labelled as such, to the narrator
in :mod:`modules.report.advisor`, which gets these quotes in its prompt and is the one
component allowed to speculate. The distinction is the whole reason a report
that quotes the footage is worth more than one that paraphrases it: a quote can
be checked against the video in one click, and a paraphrase cannot.

Speech is also not evidence of importance, and this module never treats it as
such. A stretch can be silent and be the point of the video. All the numbers
here describe the soundtrack; none of them rank it.
