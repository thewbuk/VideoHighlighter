"""Rank what was on screen against the rest of the same video.

The report can already say a clip outscored 97% of the video. That is a fact
about the weight table, and it answers "did the arithmetic pick this" rather
than "what is different about this moment". A reader who disagrees with a pick
is disagreeing about the second question, and nothing in the record spoke to it.

This module measures the *subjects* instead, and every number it produces is a
comparison against the same video's own distribution:

* **Frame share** — how much of the frame a detected class occupies at its
  largest here, against how large it gets in the video's other stretches.
* **Relative scale** — that same box divided by a co-present box of another
  class. Frame share alone cannot tell "the subject is larger" from "the camera
  is closer"; a ratio between two things in the *same frame* can, because moving
  the camera scales both. This is the only size claim here worth much, and it is
  reported with the reference class named so the reader can judge it.
* **Prevalence** — what share of the video's detected seconds carry this class
  at all. A class that shows up in 3% of the file is itself why a moment stands
  out, whatever it scored.
* **Persistence** — how much of the clip the class is actually present for,
  which is the difference between a subject and a single-frame flicker that a
  percentile would otherwise dress up as a finding.
* **Expression standing** — which built-in expression class dominates the clip,
  how strongly it read against the video's other stretches, and how far the
  clip's mix departs from the whole file's.

Three disciplines hold throughout.

**Like is compared with like.** A clip is described by its strongest moment, so
ranking that against the video's *individual seconds* is biased upward by
construction: any twelve-second clip contains a close-up, and every clip in a
report comes out in the eightieth percentile. Every ranking here is therefore
against windows of the clip's own length — "larger than in 90% of this video's
other twelve-second stretches" is a claim that means something, and the naive
version is a claim that every clip can make.

**Sample counts travel with every percentile.** Windows overlap, so the number
of them overstates how much independent evidence there is; the record reports
the count divided back down into whole stretches, and :data:`MIN_STRETCHES`
marks where a rank becomes reportable. Nothing is suppressed — the caller sees
the count and can decide — but the flag means the prose layer does not have to
re-derive the judgement.

**This module computes, it does not characterise.** No thresholds for "unusual",
no adjectives, no ordering by significance beyond a stable sort. What is worth
saying out loud is :mod:`modules.report.highlight_prose`'s decision, exactly as it is
for every other measurement in the report. Keeping the split means a threshold
lives in one place instead of two that drift.

Content is not this module's business: it compares a class against itself and
holds no vocabulary of its own. Whatever the detector was taught to find, the
same arithmetic applies.
