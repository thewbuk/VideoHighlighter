"""What it would take to measure something this run had no signal for.

:mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap` and :mod:`modules.report.uncovered_claims` both end in
the same place: *this was said, and nothing here was watching for it*. The
question a user asks next is not "which weight do I change" — no weight helps —
but **"so how would I detect it, and is it worth the trouble?"** That question
has a small number of real answers in this application, they differ by an order
of magnitude in cost, and choosing badly between them is expensive: teaching a
category takes minutes and training a class takes an afternoon, and people
reliably reach for the second when the first would have done.

So the answers are enumerated here, with what each one *gives* you and what it
*costs*, and two of them are picked: the cheapest thing that would actually
measure it, and the most reliable thing available. Two rather than a list,
because a list of six routes is a decision handed back to the person who asked.

What this module does not know
------------------------------

**What was said.** It is never given the claim, and could not use it — deciding
that a spoken word describes an object rather than a movement is a judgement
about subject matter, and this repo ships no vocabulary to make it with (see
CLAUDE.md, and :mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap` for the same refusal). So a route
is not selected by what the thing *is*. Each one instead carries the condition
it holds under, in the user's own terms — "if you can point at frames showing
it", "if it fills a good part of the frame" — and the reader, who can see their
own footage, settles in a second what no lexicon here could settle at all.

**Whether it will work.** Every figure below is a cost, not a promise. The one
route whose success is genuinely unpredictable — an open-vocabulary query, which
is excellent on ordinary things and can be nearly blind on specialised subject
matter — is therefore offered as a *probe* rather than as a recommendation: five
minutes with a control query says whether it can see your subject at all, and
that answer is worth having before committing to an afternoon of labelling.

What it does know is which routes this particular run has the prerequisites for,
and that is read from the record: how many classes the detector produced (a
composition rule needs at least two to arrange), whether a CLIP index was ever
built (chapters say so — their `method` is "visual" when one was), whether a
face scan ran. A route offered without its prerequisite is a route the user
discovers is unavailable after deciding on it.

And which engines this *build* has at all. Each route names the module it needs
and is dropped when that module is not importable, which is what lets one file
serve both editions honestly: the editions ship different engines, and a route
recommending something this build cannot run is the same failure as one
recommending a class the detector never emits — it costs the user a decision
before they find out. Detected rather than declared, so no edition flag has to
be threaded here and nothing goes stale when the boundary moves.

The costs quoted here come from ``docs/DETECTION-GUIDE.md`` and are measured,
not estimated. When they change, change them there and here together.
