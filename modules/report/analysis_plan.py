"""Decide what a *second* run still has to compute, given what the cache holds.

This module exists because one bug kept coming back in different clothes.

The analysis cache keys on analysis *inputs* — what to look for, at what
sampling rate, with which detector. Scoring **points** are deliberately not part
of that key, and rightly so: changing a weight must not discard an hour of
transcription (see ``modules.media.video_cache.build_analysis_cache_params``).

But several points do double duty. They are also the switch that decides whether
a detector runs at all — "all motion points are zero, so don't bother detecting
motion". The moment a setting both (a) gates an analysis artifact and (b) sits
outside the cache signature, this happens:

1. A run with the points at zero skips the detector and caches an empty list.
2. The user raises the points, hoping for more signal.
3. Same inputs, so the same cache key: the cached pass loads the empty list.
4. Nothing re-detects. The new weight scores against nothing, forever.

The failure is silent because **an empty list is a legal answer**. "Detected
nothing" and "never looked" are stored identically, and no later code can tell
them apart. Every instance so far — motion, audio peaks, the report's detection
boxes, composed event names, the waveform — was found by a user noticing a
feature had quietly stopped working, then fixed by hand at that one call site.

So the predicate gets a name, one implementation, and a test that fails when a
new gated artifact is added without handling this. The point is not that
:func:`needs_backfill` is hard — it is three clauses — but that it is *declared*
in :data:`GATED_ARTIFACTS`, where the invariant test can see it.

Nothing here does I/O or knows what a detector is. It answers one question about
two dicts, which is what makes the second-run behaviour testable without a video
— see ``tests/test_analysis_plan.py``.
