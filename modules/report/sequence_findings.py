"""What happened, in what order, how far apart — and what the run cannot say.

Composition rules test *state*: whether something holds at a second. That is
most of what a report needs and it cannot express the other part, which is
**order and interval**. "A was present, then B, four seconds later" is not a
rule about a second; it is a relation between two of them, and nothing here
could state it before this module.

Order matters wherever a sequence is the subject rather than a tally. The
interval between two observations is frequently the whole question, and it is
exactly what is tedious to recover by hand from a report that lists moments
independently.

The second half is the part that took a session to learn to want.

Why a "not established" list ships with the findings
----------------------------------------------------

A report that lists what it found, and stops, invites the reader to treat its
silence as absence. It is not: it is the boundary of what ran. Worse, a model
asked to summarise such a report will fill the silence, confidently and in the
same voice as the measurements — which is how a run that measured six things
becomes a paragraph asserting a dozen.

So every result carries the questions this run **structurally cannot answer**,
stated as plainly as the ones it can. Some of those are permanent:

- *what anyone knew, intended, perceived or felt.* Nothing observable from
  outside a person establishes it, and a classifier's label for an appearance
  is not a reading of a mind.
- *whether a thing is what it looks like.* A detector reports appearance. What
  something actually was is a fact about the world, not about the pixels.
- *why one thing followed another.* Two observations in order are two
  observations in order. Sequence is not cause, and this module reports the
  interval precisely so that the reader supplies the rest.
- *anything outside the frame or outside the analysed span.*

Others are conditional on what actually ran, and are computed rather than
recited: a detector with no activity establishes nothing about its subject, and
saying which ones were silent is more useful than an empty section.

The voiceover check
-------------------

Speech is treated as evidence about the material, which is wrong when the audio
is *about* the material instead of from within it. Narration, commentary and
dubbing all read to a transcript exactly like dialogue. The heuristic is
unglamorous and works: one speaker holding nearly the whole runtime, at an even
rate, is far more likely to be describing the footage than to be in it. When
that trips, the quotes are reported as description of the material rather than
as something that happened in it, and "what was said within the material"
joins the not-established list.

That distinction changes what a report means. A narrated clip can assert
outcomes, names and conclusions that no detector saw and that the footage does
not show, and without the check those sentences sit beside the measurements
looking like more of them.

Scope
-----

Built from the report's kept moments, so the sequence covers the analysed
selection rather than every second of the source. Where coverage is partial the
result says so, because "first seen at" means "first seen in what was kept".
