"""What the video talks about that nothing in the run could see.

The report can now quote what was said and list what was detected, and the
interesting thing about having both is the *difference* between them. A stretch
where somebody names something repeatedly, and no class the detector owns covers
it, is a hole in what this run was able to check — and it is a hole the record
can point at precisely, because both halves are already measured.

This matters more than it sounds. A narrator handed a transcript will describe
what people say happened; the measurements can only confirm the parts something
was watching for. Without this module the two are silently different sizes, and
a reader has no way to tell a claim the signals corroborate from one they merely
failed to contradict. Naming the gap is what turns "the model said so" into "the
model said so, and here is what would have to exist for the run to check it".

How the gap is found
--------------------

Two sets, both already computed. The spoken side is
:func:`modules.segments.chapter_speech.distinctive_words` — words a stretch says far more
often than the rest of the video. The seen side is every class the detector
actually produced in this file, plus every composed event the rules can emit.
A word is *covered* when it appears among the tokens of some class or event
name, and *unseen* when it does not.

Matching is token equality and nothing cleverer. No stemming, no synonyms, no
lexicon: a synonym table is a vocabulary, this repo ships none, and one written
for English would be wrong the first time somebody transcribes anything else.
The consequence is that the gap over-reports -- a word can be covered in meaning
by a class it does not share a token with -- and that is the right direction to
be wrong in. Everything here is a *candidate for a person to look at*, and the
cost of an extra candidate is a glance, while the cost of a missed one is a
claim nobody realises went unchecked.

What this module will not do
----------------------------

It does not decide what any word means, propose what to detect, or rank one gap
as more worth closing than another beyond how distinctive the word was. Those
are judgements, and they belong to the user or -- with the user's approval
before anything is written -- to :mod:`modules.rules.rule_proposal`. This file only
says: *this was talked about, and nothing here was watching for it.*
