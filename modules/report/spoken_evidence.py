"""What the video talks about that this run *did* measure.

:mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap` computes half of a comparison and drops the other
half on the floor. It matches the words a stretch says against the names of the
classes the detector actually produced, and reports the **misses** — things
talked about that nothing was watching for. The **hits** are thrown away, and
the hits are the more useful half.

The case that makes this obvious: somebody on camera names a moment and says it
was the best one. If nothing in the run was watching for that thing, the gap
list is the honest answer — nobody can check it. But if the run *did* label it,
then this report is holding the answer and not saying it. It knows how many
seconds of the video carry that label, which stretch holds most of them, how
loud the video was there, what else was on screen at that moment, and whether
the cut took anything from it. A narrator handed only the transcript will
paraphrase the claim back as if repeating it were confirming it. Handed the
measurement, it can agree with the speaker, or disagree, and either is worth
more than the paraphrase.

That last part is the point. This module exists to make **disagreement
possible**, not to decorate claims that were going to be repeated anyway. A
speaker naming their favourite moment, over a label the run found in a handful
of seconds and put in none of the kept clips, is the most useful row this report
can produce, and it is exactly the row a transcript alone cannot make.

Matching: two tiers, and why one is not enough
----------------------------------------------

The obvious rule is that a line names a class when every token of the class name
appears in it. That rule was written first and it fired on **nothing**, on real
footage, against classes that were plainly the subject of the conversation.

People abbreviate and elide. A class name is a label somebody typed once; speech
shortens it, drops the second half, or contracts it to an initial that
tokenising discards for being one character long. Matching the full name only
finds the speaker who happened to say the label the way it was typed, which is
the rarest way of saying it. The rule was silently strict, and a section that
never appears looks exactly like a section that has nothing to report.

So there are two tiers, and both are token equality — no stemming, no synonyms,
no lexicon, for the reason :mod:`modules.report.vocabulary_gap` gives: a synonym table
is a vocabulary, this repo ships none, and one written for English would be
wrong the first time somebody transcribes anything else.

**Named in full.** Some line covers every token of a class name. Strong, quoted
as-is, and not required to be distinctive of anything — saying the whole label
is evidence enough on its own.

**Named by a word.** One of the words this stretch says far more often than the
rest of the video (:func:`modules.segments.chapter_speech.distinctive_words`) is a token
of some class name. This is the tier that fires in practice, and the keyness
bar is what keeps it honest: a class named after an ordinary word cannot match
unless the stretch is *about* that word, so a common token does not paint the
whole report.

A word will often be a token of several class names at once, and that is
reported rather than resolved: the row names every class the word covers, each
with its own measurement. Which one the speaker meant is not decidable here, and
the comparison between them is usually the answer anyway — the same word
covering one class the run found everywhere and another it barely found at all
says more than either figure alone.

What a match does not mean
--------------------------

That the same words were used. Nothing else. The speaker may be using a word in
a sense with no relation to what the detector was taught to find, and this
module cannot tell. Every row therefore carries the line it was matched from,
and the narrator is told this in as many words, so a reader — or a model — can
see the sentence and decide whether the two are about the same thing at all.

Where the evidence is measured from
-----------------------------------

The **whole video**, not the stretch the sentence was said in. People describe
in the last five minutes something that happened in the middle, and a row that
looked only at the current chapter would answer "your favourite moment never
happened" about a moment that plainly did. The chapter the claim was *made* in
decides where the row is filed; the chapter the label is *densest* in is part
of what the row says. :func:`modules.narration.chapter_story._checks_here` files its rows
the same way and for the same reason.

Two ways in
-----------

:func:`attach` runs inside :func:`modules.report.highlight_report.build_report`, off
the per-second labels, and measures everything.

:func:`from_report` derives what it can from a finished report on disk, and
exists because of how this feature is actually used. Analysis is expensive and
run once; the narration is re-run over the saved record afterwards, as often as
the user likes. Without a backfill this section could only ever appear on a
video re-analysed from scratch, which for the report it most wants to improve
means paying for the detectors again to add a paragraph. The record does not
carry per-second levels, so that path reports a class's loudest *kept clip*
instead of its loudest second, and says which of the two it has.

Everything reported is arithmetic over figures the report already holds.
Nothing here interprets, ranks a claim as true or false, or knows one class name
from another.
