"""Work out whether a video packs two eyes into one frame.

Side-by-side footage — 180° VR, and stereo 3D generally — stores the left and
right eye next to each other inside a single frame. Every view of a frame in
this app already knows how to show just the left one (`modules.media.video_regions`
for analysis, the player's crop, the thumbnail cache); what none of them had
was a way to find out that they should, short of the user ticking a box.

Untold, a filmstrip is at its worst on exactly this footage. Drawn whole, each
thumbnail is the same moment twice at half the size; drawn into a slot narrower
than the frame, the painter centre-crops, and the centre of a side-by-side
frame is the seam between the eyes — so the one part of the picture guaranteed
to show nothing is the part that survives.

The checkbox stays the final word: this only decides where it starts, and a
wrong guess is one click from being corrected.

Two questions, asked in this order because the first is free:

* **Could this be side-by-side?** Two eyes make a frame twice as wide as one
  eye, and an eye is a shape somebody actually shoots — square (fisheye or
  equirectangular 180°), 4:3, or 16:9. That rejects nearly everything without
  decoding a pixel, and in particular it rejects a 2.39:1 scope film, whose
  halves would be 1.19:1 — a shape no camera produces.

* **Is it?** The geometry gate lets through the one family it cannot tell apart
  from side-by-side: a monoscopic 360° panorama is 2:1 as well, and so is a
  film shot 2:1. So the halves are compared, shrunk to 8×8 first — coarse
  enough that parallax washes out, which matters more than it sounds, because
  a subject close to the camera moves a long way between the eyes. Measured
  over seven VR files the halves then correlate 0.74–1.00, while a panorama's
  reach 0.51 and unrelated pictures sit near zero.

Correlation alone is not enough: a centred, symmetric composition — mirrored
letterbox bars, a face in the middle of a blurred background — pushes a flat
frame's halves to 0.95 on its own. So a sample must also beat its own control,
the right half *mirrored*. Two eyes are a copy, not a reflection, so stereo
wins that comparison; a symmetric flat frame cannot, because a reflection is
exactly what its halves are.

Neither test is trusted on one frame — both directions have believable-looking
single frames — so three are taken across the running time and the majority
decides. A sample carrying no detail (a fade, a black frame, a title card) is
discarded rather than believed, because every such frame's halves match.
