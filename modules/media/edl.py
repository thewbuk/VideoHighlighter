"""
edl.py — the cut list: which piece of which file, in what order, joined how.

Why this exists
===============
:mod:`modules.segments.script_plan` says what the film should *contain* ("three action
beats of about eight seconds"). It is an intention, and the engine answers it
by scoring. That is the right shape for the first pass and the wrong shape for
the second, because once you have watched the result the note you have is never
"make beat two more actiony" — it is "that third clip should start two seconds
later, and lose the one after it".

An EDL is that second shape: explicit sources and explicit timestamps. It is
what the automatic pass emits, so the machine's answer arrives as an editable
document rather than as a finished file you can only accept or re-roll. Edit
the numbers, render again, and only the changed part of your intent moves.

Timestamps
==========
Written the way people write them — ``8``, ``0:08``, ``1:23.5``, ``01:02:03.5``
— and always emitted as ``M:SS.s`` (or ``H:MM:SS.s`` past an hour), because a
list of raw seconds is unreadable at exactly the moment you most need to read
it. Parsing is strict about nonsense (``1:2:3:4``, ``abc``, negative times) and
liberal about form.

The transition on a cut is the one *leaving* it, toward the next cut. The last
cut's transition is therefore meaningless and is ignored rather than rejected —
deleting the final clip of a reel should not also require you to remember to
clear a field on the one before it.

Round trip
==========
    run the pipeline -> edl_from_clips(...) -> film.edl.yaml   (edit it)
                     -> load_edl(...) -> render_edl(...)       -> film.mp4

``render_edl`` cuts each source at its timestamps and hands the pieces to
:mod:`modules.media.transitions`, so everything that module knows about blending,
clamping and delivery size applies unchanged.

    This is what actually makes an edit land on the music, and it is worth
    being precise about why it works on *durations* rather than on positions.
    A reel is played back to back, so the time a cut happens is the sum of
    every clip before it. Snapping each clip's start to the nearest beat of the
    track would therefore snap nothing — the clip does not begin where its
    source timestamp says, it begins wherever the previous clips ended. What
    has to be a whole number of bars is the *advance*: how far the reel moves
    on per clip.

    With hard cuts the advance is the clip length and one bar per clip is
    right. With a transition it is not, because the two clips overlap: the
    advance is ``duration - transition``, so a clip of exactly one bar advances
    the reel by less than a bar and every join after the first drifts further
    off. Measured on a real render — 3.64 s bars, 0.6 s crossfades — the third
    join landed 1.8 s off the beat, which is half a bar and audible as being
    simply wrong. Each clip therefore gets its own transition added back on
    top, so ``duration - transition`` is the bar and every transition *starts*
    exactly on a downbeat.

    A cut is never lengthened past the end of its source. When the nearest
    whole number of units would run off the end, the *next lower* whole number
    is used rather than the leftover footage: a 6.03 s clip against a 3.64 s
    bar rounds to two bars, cannot have them, and becomes one bar — not 6.03 s,
    which is what simply clamping gives and is not on the beat at all. Losing
    two seconds of a clip is the price of the cut landing where the music says.
    Only a clip with less than one whole unit available keeps its own length
    and breaks the pattern, because the alternative is a clip too short to see.

    ``transition_bars`` also sets each transition's length from the bar, since a
    blend that is a musical fraction is the other half of the same idea. Left
    at 0 the existing durations are untouched.
