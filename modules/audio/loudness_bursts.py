"""Group loudness excursions into events worth a person's time.

``modules/audio/reaction_bursts.py`` measures; this decides. The split matters: the
measurement is a property of the audio and means the same thing everywhere, but
every number below is a *policy* choice about what to surface, and policy that
suits one kind of material suits another badly. Keeping them apart is what lets
the thresholds move without the measurement moving.

Three things happen here that a raw candidate list does not do:

**Ranking by excursion rather than rhythm.** ``find_candidates`` orders by
syllabic modulation by default, which is right when the question is "is there
laughter here". On material whose rhythm is ordinary speech it is wrong in a way
that hides the answer, so this asks for ``rank_by="z"``. See that function's
docstring for the measurement behind the choice.

**An edge guard.** Opening and closing minutes carry titles, music beds and
encoding artifacts, all of which are loud against a quiet neighbourhood and none
of which are content. Measured on an hour of material, 18 of 48 raw candidates
fell in the first and last two minutes.

**Merging.** Candidates are per-run, and one event produces many of them -- the
same hour put 12 runs inside a four-minute stretch. Merging by a gap turns a
list of runs into a list of *moments*, which is the unit a person reviews and
the unit a clip gets cut around.

The defaults were fitted on two hours of material mastered 17 dB apart (median
loudness -37 and -20 dBFS) and gave 11 and 14 events per hour, of which the
person who supplied the material judged 10/11 and 12/12 to be real. They are
offered as a starting point, not a discovery: the honest reading is that a
z-score against a rolling median transfers across mastering where an absolute
dB threshold cannot, which is the same lesson ``modules/audio/audio_peaks.py``'s
fixed -20 dBFS threshold teaches by failing.

**A known limitation, stated because it will be met.** The baseline is a median
over a rolling window, so a *sustained* loud passage raises its own reference
and its excursions shrink. Where more than about half of a window is loud, the
median becomes the loud level and events there go unreported. Widening the
window does not fix it -- the spread widens with it and the z-score shrinks
faster than the excursion grows (measured: at +/-300s, recall fell from 8/9 to
6/9). Adding an absolute criterion recovers such passages but costs far more
than it returns at any threshold that keeps the list reviewable. So: this finds
moments that stand out from their surroundings, and a passage that is loud
throughout is not one.
