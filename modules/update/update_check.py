"""Tell the user when a newer build exists.

Why this is notify-only
-----------------------
The app is delivered as a multi-gigabyte archive, so "download and run the new
one for you" would mean fetching several GB and then executing it — a remote
code execution channel into every customer machine, and the one bug class that
cannot be recalled once shipped. The value the user actually wants is *knowing*
a new build exists; the download itself is one click on a page. So this module
fetches a small JSON manifest, compares versions, and stops there.

The manifest format already carries ``assets`` (with sizes and SHA-256) and a
``signature`` field, unused today. That is deliberate: if downloading is added
later, the wire format does not change, and the rule for that day is written
down here — **verify the signature against an embedded public key before any
downloaded byte is executed**, exactly as ``licensing.py`` verifies tokens.
GitHub account compromise and MITM both stop at that check; without it, neither
does.

What is sent
------------
Nothing. A plain GET of a public static file, no query string, no identifiers,
no license key. The manifest host learns an IP made a request, which is what
any download link already reveals.

Failure policy
--------------
Every failure is silent — no network, DNS down, garbage JSON, a manifest that
has not been published yet. An update check must never produce an error dialog
or block startup; the user did not ask for it.

Edition
-------
The manifest URL is chosen from ``version.__edition__``, so this file is
identical in the Pro and free repos and picks its own channel at runtime.
