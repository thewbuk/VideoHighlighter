"""Fetch the files an update plan asks for, into a staging directory.

Nothing here touches the installed app. Files land in a staging folder and are
verified there; only ``update_apply`` moves them into place. That separation is
what makes a failed or cancelled download a non-event — the install is
untouched until every byte is present and checked.

Two rules:

**A file is not trusted until its hash matches.** Every download is verified
against the SHA-256 in the signed manifest before it counts as staged. A
truncated download, a proxy serving an error page as 200, or a tampered file
all fail the same check. The wrong bytes never reach the install directory.

**Interrupted work is kept.** Staged files that already match are skipped, so
cancelling and retrying resumes rather than starting over — which matters when
the payload is large and the connection is not.

Host-agnostic on purpose: the base URL and any auth headers are passed in, so
the same code serves a public release host or a gated one.

    ``content`` (the default) addresses files by their SHA-256 rather than by

    the indirection —

    * a file that did not change between releases is *already* on the host, so
      publishing a release uploads only genuinely new bytes (the multi-GB
      models get uploaded exactly once, ever);
    * an install can jump 0.9.0 -> 0.9.4 directly, because every blob any
      version ever referenced is still addressable;
    * blobs are immutable, so they can be cached forever and can never be
      silently swapped for different content under the same URL.

    ``path`` mirrors the install tree instead (``<base>/_internal/app.py``),
    for a host where a browsable layout matters more.
