"""The list of local models the report can be written with, and how it is stored.

One model was enough while the narrator did one job. It does two now — advising
on the settings and reading the footage — and they suit different models: a small
instruction-tuned one answers "which weight should I raise" in a sentence, where
reading a scene wants something larger, and a vision model wants a projector file
alongside it that the single-model setting had nowhere to put.

So the app keeps a list and the user picks per run. Everything here is the pure
half of that: parsing what was stored, migrating what was stored before, and
naming an entry for a menu. The Qt half lives with the rest of the window.

Stored as JSON in one settings value rather than as a settings group per model,
because the alternative is inventing keys at runtime and then discovering which
of them still exist — and because a list the user can copy between machines in
one line is worth more than a tidier registry they cannot.
