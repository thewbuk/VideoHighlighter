"""Which backend narration should use on this machine, and why.

Narration is the most expensive thing a run does, and on Intel hardware the
difference between the two available paths is large: measured on an Arc A750,
41 tok/s against 8.85 with a picture in the context, and an image encode of
about a second against twelve. The second figure is the structural one — a
vision tower is an OpenVINO graph and runs on the GPU, where llama.cpp falls
back to the CPU for it whichever GPU backend it was given. `docs/INTEL-GPU.md`
has the measurements.

So on Intel the faster path should be the one taken, and the user should not
have to know any of the above to get it.

The reason this is a module rather than an `if` is that **the fast path can be
unavailable for four different reasons**, and each needs a different sentence.
No Intel GPU is not a problem at all. No `openvino-genai` is a missing install.
No converted model is a setup step nobody has done yet — the one thing here
that costs an hour and several gigabytes, and the thing a user is most likely
to have skipped without realising it was expected. Silence, or one generic
"falling back to Ollama", would leave all four looking identical.

Nothing here loads a model or imports a heavy library at module scope: this is
asked during preflight, before a run commits to anything.
