# PyInstaller spec for the FastAPI sidecar bundled into the Tauri app.
#
# The sidecar imports the same engine as main.py (pipeline -> torch/cv2/whisper/
# yolox/openvino), so the collection flags mirror .github/workflows/
# build-release.yaml. Differences from the Qt build:
#   * console app, not --windowed: it's a child process, never user-facing, and
#     its stdout is piped to the Tauri log.
#   * no PySide6/Qt: the sidecar never draws anything.
#   * onedir, not onefile: a onefile build unpacks ~2GB of torch/openvino to a
#     temp dir on every launch, which would add many seconds to app startup.
#
# Build:  pyinstaller packaging/vh-sidecar.spec --noconfirm
# Output: dist/vh-sidecar/vh-sidecar.exe

# Drop torch's vendored third-party license texts.
#
# torch ships its transitive vendors' licenses nested ~9 levels deep (kineto ->
# dynolog -> prometheus-cpp -> civetweb -> duktape). Harmless in the onedir
# build, but the MSI bundler builds paths as
# `...\src-tauri\..\..\dist-sidecar\...` -- unresolved, with the `..\..` still
# in the string -- and WiX 3.14 doesn't opt into long paths, so anything over
# MAX_PATH (260) makes `light.exe` fail with LGHT0103 "cannot find the file".
# The deepest are 280 chars, so the MSI can't build while they're bundled.
#
# They're license texts inside .dist-info metadata that nothing imports; torch's
# own LICENSE/NOTICE at the dist-info root are shallow and stay. Filter by depth
# rather than name so a future torch that vendors something new stays buildable.
